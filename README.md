Sentiment Analysis
ðŸ“„ Project Overview
Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies text data as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It helps businesses, researchers, and developers analyze opinions from customer reviews, social media posts, or survey responses to gain actionable insights.
This project is implemented in Python using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for preprocessing, classification, and visualization.

âœ¨ Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lowercasing, and normalization
Feature Extraction: Bag-of-Words (BoW) or TF-IDF
Sentiment Classification: Categorizes text as positive, negative, or neutral
Data Visualization: Charts showing sentiment distribution
Custom Dataset Support: Easily adapt to any text dataset

ðŸ›  Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-link>
Navigate to the project directory:

cd sentiment-analysis
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸš€ Usage
Prepare your dataset (CSV, Excel, or text file).
